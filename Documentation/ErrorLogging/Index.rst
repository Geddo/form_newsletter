=============
Error Logging
=============

If an exception is thrown while trying to communicate with the API, the
extension will create an entry in the log file.
The error message will also be displayed at the end of the entry.
You can find the log file here: :file:`typo3temp/var/log`.

In case of an error the extension will always redirect to the failure page.
